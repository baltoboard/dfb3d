The dfb3d package contains a basic Wavefront .obj based on df_knuckles
that can be used to test and demonstrate events and rendering DirectFB
features. The source code of these examples is provided under the
terms of the MIT license. See the file COPYING for details.

The package also ships sample Wavefront .obj files that will be installed into
${prefix}/share/directfb-examples.

After installation the dfb3d demo can be run:

   with no parameter, will run the original skull provided by df_knuckles code

   with "--obj3d <path_to_file_Wavefront_.obj>", will parse and run the .obj
